## Description

I created this command-line application to help software engineering managers keep track of their team members. It provides an easy to use interfrace that utilizes the Inquirer package via node.js.

In creating this project, I learned alot about Object-Oriented Programming and unit testing. My unit testing was done by using the Jest testing framework.
